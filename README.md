## Two strategies from frontside perspecitve

### Decompozition
- Microfrontend: Breaks down monolithic frontend into smaller, independent applications.
- Nanofrontend: Takes granularity to the extreme, treating individual components as separate entities.

### Decoupling
- Headless: Separates frontend from backend, allowing flexibility and content management.
- Frontendless: focuses on minimizing the traditional frontend layer, while Headless emphasizes decoupling frontend and backend.


## Headless:
In the context of web development, a headless architecture refers to separating the frontend (presentation layer) from the backend (content management and business logic).

### Characteristics:
- The frontend communicates with the backend via APIs.
- Allows flexibility in choosing frontend technologies (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
- Ideal for building decoupled systems, such as single-page applications (SPAs) or mobile apps.
- Enables content management through a headless CMS.

### Example:
Using a headless CMS like Contentful or Strapi with a React frontend.



## MicroFrontend
Microfrontends apply the concept of microservices to the browser side. They break down a monolithic frontend application into smaller, independent front-end applications.

### Characteristics:
- Each frontend application can be standalone, independently developed, and deployed.
- Components can be shared across microfrontends.
- Can be managed via NPM, Git, or other tools.

### Implementation Approaches:
- Route Dispatch: Dynamically load microfrontends based on routes.
- iFrame Containers: Embed microfrontends within iframes.
- Web Components: Use native web components for integration.

### Example:
Building a complex application by combining multiple smaller front-end applications.



## NanoFrontend:
A more granular approach than microfrontends, where individual components are treated as nanofrontends.

### Characteristics:

- Extremely fine-grained separation of concerns.
- Each component is independently deployable.
- Often used in scenarios where extreme isolation is required.


## Example:

Breaking down a large application into tiny, reusable components (e.g., buttons, forms).



## FrontendLess

The term "frontendless" refers to an architectural approach where the traditional frontend layer of a web application is either minimized or eliminated altogether:
- Frontendless implies that there is little to no dedicated frontend code responsible for rendering the user interface (UI) in the traditional sense.
- Instead of relying on a monolithic frontend, frontendless architectures distribute UI-related responsibilities across other layers or services.

Frontendless architectures aim to streamline UI development by distributing responsibilities across various layers, services, or components. Whether it's SSR, microfrontends, or web components, the goal is to achieve flexibility, maintainability, and scalability while minimizing the traditional frontend footprint. üöÄ


### Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
- In SSR, the server generates HTML content dynamically and sends it to the client.
- The client receives pre-rendered HTML, which reduces the need for extensive client-side JavaScript.
- While not entirely frontendless, SSR minimizes the client-side codebase.
  
### API-First or Headless Architectures:
- Similar to headless architectures, where the frontend is decoupled from the backend.
- APIs serve as the primary means of communication between the client and the server.
- The client (frontend) consumes data via APIs and handles UI rendering.
  
### Client-Side Rendering (CSR) with Microfrontends:
- Divide the frontend into smaller, independently deployable microfrontends.
- Each microfrontend handles a specific part of the UI.
- The overall application remains lightweight and modular.
  
### Web Components:
- Use native web components (custom elements) to create reusable UI elements.
- These components can be shared across different projects.
- Encourages a frontendless mindset by focusing on component-based development.

### Benefits:
- Reduced Complexity: By minimizing frontend code, maintenance becomes simpler.
- Scalability: Microfrontends and web components allow for scalable UI development.
- Flexibility: Choose technologies and frameworks independently for different parts of the UI.

### Challenges:
- Initial Learning Curve: Adapting to a frontendless approach may require a shift in mindset.
- Integration: Ensuring seamless communication between microfrontends or components.
- Tooling and Infrastructure: Setting up build pipelines and deployment processes.




## Modular/Atomized Streamed Interface

### Modular Interfacing
- Definition: Modular interfacing refers to connecting different components or systems in a modular fashion, allowing them to communicate seamlessly.
- Example: In the context of music production and synthesis, modular interfacing involves connecting a modular synthesizer (such as a Eurorack system) to a computer-based digital audio workstation (DAW).
- Challenges: One challenge is bridging the gap between Control Voltage (CV) signals (used in modular synths) and audio signals (used in DAWs).
- DC-Coupled Audio Interfaces: To facilitate CV communication, you'll need a DC-coupled audio interface. These interfaces allow both audio and CV signals to flow between your modular system and your DAW.
- Expert Sleepers ES-8 and ES-9: The Expert Sleepers ES-8 and ES-9 are popular DC-coupled audio interface modules that connect via USB and serve as the audio engine for your DAW. They provide inputs and outputs for CV signals, making them ideal for integrating modular and digital environments.
  
### Types of Modular Interface Design
- Bus Modular Architecture:
    - In this design, elements connect to a common bus or base element through the same type of interface.
    - Example: Using a 4-Port USB hub as the base element to connect various USB peripherals.
- GPIO Ports on Raspberry Pi Zero W:
    - Another example of modular interfacing is connecting different sensors to the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) ports on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
    - Each sensor communicates with the base element (Raspberry Pi) via a specific interface.
      
### Optimizing Digital Streaming
- While not directly related to modular synthesis, optimizing digital streaming interfaces is crucial for high-quality audio.
- Purpose-designed components, such as optical fiber interfaces, enhance functionality, flexibility, and audio quality when streaming digital content from computers to DACs or integrated amps.
  
In summary, modular interfacing involves creating flexible connections between components, whether in music synthesis, general electronics, or digital streaming. Whether you're patching CV signals, connecting sensors, or optimizing audio streaming, the key is adaptability and efficient communication. üéõÔ∏èüîåüé∂





## Frontendless vs Headless architectures:

### Frontendless:
A Frontendless architecture minimizes or eliminates the traditional frontend layer of a web application.
- Characteristics:
    - Reduced Frontend Footprint: In a Frontendless approach, the UI rendering responsibilities are distributed across other layers or services.
    - Examples:
        - Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Pre-rendering HTML on the server side and sending it to the client.
        - Web Components: Creating reusable UI elements using native web components.
        - Microfrontends: Breaking down the frontend into independently deployable microfrontends.
- Benefits:
    - Simplicity: Maintenance becomes simpler with fewer frontend components.
    - Scalability: Modular approaches allow for scalable UI development.
    - Flexibility: Choose technologies independently for different parts of the UI.
      
### Headless:
A Headless architecture decouples the frontend (presentation layer) from the backend (content management and business logic).
- Characteristics:
    - API-First Approach: Communication between frontend and backend occurs via APIs.
    - Advantages:
        - Scalability: Ideal for building decoupled systems (e.g., single-page applications).
        - Content Management: Enables using a headless CMS.
        - Resource Efficiency: Doesn't require resources for rendering graphical elements.
- Examples of Headless CMS:
    - Contentful, Strapi, or Prismic.
    - Frameworks: React, Angular, or Vue.js.
      
### Comparison:
Frontendless focuses on minimizing the traditional frontend layer, while Headless emphasizes decoupling frontend and backend.
- Use Cases:
    - Choose Frontendless for extreme simplicity and modular UI development.
    - Opt for Headless when scalability, content management, and resource efficiency are critical.

### Abstract

Micro-frontends are a strategy for splitting user interfaces up into separately deployable units. 
This gives teams great latitude to choose their own technologies and think in terms of self-contained programs. 

+ per page frontend approach has disadvantages: pages cannot be shared by teams
+ sub-frontends are hard to modalularize and the user must download and execute duplicate JavaScript. 

Nano-frontends are an alternative that give teams similar freedoms but provide opt-in optimisations to improve user experience.


Write your frontends as libraries that take:
+ a DOM element to render in 
+ a set of common dependencies to call (e.g. React)
+ allow a scaffold app to render the entire thing and inject the dependencies. 
+ Libraries can be published by writing artefacts to S3 and then monitoring for changes using SNS/SQS.

## What does a 'dependency injected' frontend look like?

First we need to specify a set of dependencies


## The scaffold app

This is a simple Node/Express/React app that routes from URLs to components that each instantiate nano-frontends. Nano-frontends are loaded via dynamic `import`. For instance, on the homepage:

The scaffolding app then 'makes the decision' as to where nano-frontends go in terms of both URL and page location.
This makes it easy for teams to discuss changes or contention, and also see the state of the frontend.

## Publishing workflow

If we want teams to be independent, they need to be able to release just by updating their own repositories.

Now we commit the code and run a build with e.g. CircleCI. 
There's a testbed that can run a full browser test of our component just by injecting the necessary dependencies - including mocked dependencies. This means we can do a11y and full 'clickability' testing without having to prepare API state.

Once completed, the build process compiles the code into a bundle. Note that the dependency file only exports types, so React / ReactDOM / jss aren't included in the final bundle.

Push this to S3 and we can trigger an SNS notification (e.g. `s3:ObjectCreated:Put`). This will update the 'scaffold app' that actually renders the nano-frontend.



## Current Technologies at 2021

+ Single Page Application (SPA)
+ Progressive Web App (PWA)
+ Application as a Stream (AaaS)
    + native javascript  
    + json based communication

## The Stack

How your stack looks will depend on how you want to render your application. Here is a comprehensive discussion about that, but in a nutshell:

### Client-side rendering(CSR); SPA; JSON APIs 
This is perhaps the most popular approach. It's great for building interactive web applications. But be aware of its downsides and steps to mitigate them. This is the approach I took, so we will talk about it in a lot of detail.

### Hybrid CSR; Both client-side and server-side rendering(SSR) 
With this approach, you still build your SPA. But when a user requests your app, for example, the homepage, you render the homepage's component into its static HTML in your server and serve it to the user. Then at the user's browser, hydration will happen so the whole thing becomes the intended SPA.

### Downsides
But there are downsides too. 
Apart from the extra maintenance costs, we will have to download the same payload twice‚ÄîFirst, the HTML, and second, its Javascript counterpart for the 'hydration' which will exert significant work on the browser's main thread. 
This prolongs the 'First time to interactive', and hence diminishes the benefits gained from a faster 'First meaningful paint'.

### Examples
The technologies that are adopted for this approach are NextJs, NuxtJs, and GatsbyJs.
